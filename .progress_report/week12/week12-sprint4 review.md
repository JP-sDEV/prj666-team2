## Additinoal Note 
Due to security restrictions on the campus network, an unforeseen issue has arisen where the schoolâ€™s Wi-Fi does not allow the use of our product. However, it works fine on private Wi-Fi (at home). This issue occurred unexpectedly, and we are currently discussing how to proceed with the live demo.
